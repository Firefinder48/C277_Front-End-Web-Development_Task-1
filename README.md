# C277_Front-End-Web-Development_Task-1

A.  Create two low-level comprehensive page layouts that can be used to develop a 4–10-page website related to a U.S. state. The first layout should introduce the state (i.e., the main page) and the second layout should be for individual city pages (i.e., the state capital and two additional cities in the state).

1. Include clearly denoted placeholders for each of the following semantic elements for each page of the website:

•   a header containing introductory content (pertaining to the document as a whole or a particular section of a document)

•   a nav to place the links that allow users to navigate the site

•   a section to display the main content of the page

•   an aside to display information related to the content

Note: The low-level comprehensive page layout of your main elements for the cities will remain the same on each page, but you will customize the content on each of the pages in the next task. Realistically most sites will have several different templates for different types of pages. You are only being asked to create two pages for this task.

Note: You can use any tool to create the low-level comprehensive layout, such as graphic creation or manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or another tool of your choice.

B.  Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
